Challenge created by development courses platform Alura 

History
------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------
**After some tests with prototypes made by the UX team of a company, the first version of a platform for sharing videos was requested.** The platform should allow the user to assemble playlists with links to their favorite videos, separated by categories.

Frontend and UI teams are already working on layout and screens. For the backend, the main features to be implemented are:

1. **API with routes implemented according to the REST standard**;
2. **Validations made according to business rules**;
3. **Implementation of database for information persistence**;
4. **Authentication service to access GET, POST, PUT and DELETE routes**.

We have a 4 week time frame to develop the project. In the first 3, we will have tasks to be done and the last week for adjustments or to complete pending tasks. Let's work with the agile development system, using Trello as follows:

1. The column **Ready to start** shows the cards with the elements not yet developed.
2. Already in the column **Developing** will be the elements that you are developing at the moment. When starting a task, you can move the card containing the task to this column.
3. In **Paused** are elements that you started to develop, but had to stop for some reason.
4. Finally, the column **Complete** will have the elements already completed.

Trello is a single-use tool for you to track the progress of your activities, but it will not be evaluated.

Good project!
